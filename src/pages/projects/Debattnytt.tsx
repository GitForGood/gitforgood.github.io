This is going to be about the tinder-like web-app 
I created for a crowdsourced debate social media as a freelance project during the
summer of 2025 on behalf of a client (the owner of the website)
The user is presented with theses and swipes left and right to indicate their
judgement of how likely the thesis is to be true, the user is presented with related
articles and other content on the site that references them, and upon swiping are 
showed analytics for that thesis. 
It uses the meteorite javascript framework for the full stack, and a mongodb database.
The idea is to make engaging with arguments more approachable and less demanding on the user.
